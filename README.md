Problem Statment (IC472) :- "Prevent any malpractices in Election"
Team Name:- Innovative Thinkers

>> What is the problem in the current voting system during Election?
   In our Country, Many types of malpractices and unfair ways are used by many person to win in the elections (They use their political power) 
   like we have seen so much cases where Fake votes are casted on behalf of the person who actually had not casted their votes.
   Because, Here whole electoral process is done manually which can create such type of problems.
   
>> Our Solution:- 
   In our proposed solution, Voters can cast their votes through Iris Verification and as all of you know that iris of every single person is unique and 
   can't be cloned by anyone else.
   So, when a voter's iris matches with the database's iris details then his or her vote will be casted otherwise not. 
   So In this way, We have made the best use of biometric details of aadhar card.
   
>> What Technology We have used? 
1. We have used IR sensitivity camera to store the data of iris images of voters.
2. Then these images are compared with the data available from aadhar card of the particular voter.
3. We have used Raspberry-pi. Here in our project, when iris verification of voter will be done, Raspberry-pi will give the high signal then only EVM Machine will be 
   activated for the voter.
4. We have written whole code in Python Programming Language.
5. We used PostgreSQL(Database Management System) to create the database to store the details of voters.
   and then we connected this database to Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud server to take our local server online.
   
>> What are the benefits of our solution?
1. Our solution is very secure as compare to current solution (current voting system).
2. Through our solution, we can stop malpractices in the elections.
3. By using our project, we save approx. 26,000 litre of Ink.
4. We can digitalise our voting process.
5. Voter can cast his/her vote from anywhere in the country.
6. Our solution reduces the major expenses and workloads during elections.
7. It also saves the time and efforts of army person.
